Dear,
Every time I see your name pop on my screen, I can’t help but grin. You have really touched my heart, and you make every day brighter with your comments, thoughts, opinions and the way you share them all with me. I wonder if we could talk like that in person – share those thoughts, that laughter and that fun together. The truth is, I think I’m falling in love with you, and if you feel the same way, I think we should get together and see where this relationship goes.
Hopefully more than your friend
Honey, you know with you by my side, my day seems happier and full of love. When I heard that you never felt so much in love, I just wanted to be with you, to hug and kiss you until we both ran out of breath. I must be the luckiest girl in the world because I have your love. Every time I think about you, I can’t help but smile. You’re the reason I smile all the time now. I love you, Honey. I heard that you cherish everything between you and me. That’s really great. I never thought I would have such a lasting influence on you.
